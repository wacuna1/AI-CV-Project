# Object Detection in Live YouTube Streams

## Project Status: Active

## Installation

To use and install this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Ensure Python 3.8 or higher is installed on your machine.
3. Install required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run `python3 app.py` file to start the application.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to harness computer vision and machine learning technologies for real-time, accurate object detection in live YouTube streams. By focusing on this, we aim to unlock new potential in areas critical to modern society, such as enhanced security surveillance, efficient urban management, and advanced traffic analysis systems. Our objective is to develop a robust system that not only identifies and classifies objects in diverse streaming environments but also adapts to varying conditions with high precision and reliability.

## Project Description

This project is centered around the creation and deployment of a sophisticated object detection system, specifically tailored for live YouTube streams. Utilizing the advanced capabilities of the Ultralytics YOLO model, this system is designed to identify, classify, and track objects in real-time within dynamic streaming environments. A key aspect of our endeavor is to address and overcome challenges associated with variable lighting conditions, object occlusions, and diverse environmental settings, ensuring the system's effectiveness and accuracy in real-world applications. Moreover, we aim to optimize the system for speed and efficiency, ensuring minimal latency in real-time processing. The project not only represents a significant advancement in computer vision but also offers a versatile tool with wide-ranging applications, from urban planning and public safety to traffic management and surveillance.
